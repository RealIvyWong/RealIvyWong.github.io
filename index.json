The feasibility to diagnose and predict Cd–Pb cross-stress in agricultural soil was explored by measuring the visible and near-infrared reflectance of rice leaves. In this study, two models were developed—namely a diagnostic model and a prediction model. The diagnostic model was established based on visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) datasets with Support Vector Machine (SVM), followed by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A partial least-squares (PLS) regression, as the prediction model was employed to predict the foliar concentration of Cd and Pb contents. To accurately calibrate the two models, a rigorous greenhouse experiment was designed and implemented, with 4 levels of treatments on each of the Cd and Pb stress on rice. Results show that with the appropriate pre-processing, the diagnostic model can identify 79% of Cd and 85% of Pb stress of any levels. The significant bands that have been used mainly distributed between 681–776 nm and 1224–1349 nm for Cd stress and 712–784 nm for Pb stress. The prediction model can estimate Cd with coefficient of determination of 0.7, but failed to predict Pb accurately. The results illustrated the feasibility to diagnose Cd stress accurately by measuring the visible and near-infrared reflectance of rice canopy in a cross-contamination soil environment. This study serves as one step forward to heavy metal pollutant detection in a farmland environment.","tags":[],"title":"Repaid Identification and Prediction of Cadmium–Lead Cross-Stress of Different Stress Levels in Rice Canopy Based on Visible and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["陈奕云","齐天赐","黄颖菁","万远","赵瑞瑛","亓林","张超","费腾"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586696624,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586696624,"objectID":"a58aed55fd98a4bed7fd5e7000d65fb8","permalink":"https://realivywong.github.io/publication/tcsae-2017-33-6/","publishdate":"2020-04-12T21:03:44+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tcsae-2017-33-6/","section":"publication","summary":"土壤有机质含量可见-近红外光谱反演过程中校正集的构建策略对模型的预测精度有重要影响。以江汉平原洪湖地区水稻土为研究对象，采用Kennard-Stone（KS）法，Rank-KS（RKS）和Sample set Partitioning based on joint X-Y distance（SPXY）法，构建样本数占总校正集不同比例的子校正集，通过偏最小二乘回归，建立土壤有机质含量的可见-近红外光谱反演模型。结果表明：KS法无法提高模型预测精度，但可以在保证标准差与预测均方根误差比（ratio of performance to standard deviation，RPD）2.0的前提下减少30%的校正样本；基于SPXY法的模型，当子校正集样本比例为总校正集的50%时达到最佳的模型预测精度，RPD为2.557；RKS法能够在保证预测精度的情况下（RPD2.0），最多减少总校正集70%的样本，对应模型RPD为2.212。当校正集与验证集的有机质含量分布相近时，能够以较少的建模样本达到与总校正集相近甚至更高的模型预测精度，提升土壤有机质光谱反演模型的实用性。","tags":[],"title":"土壤有机质含量可见-近红外光谱反演模型校正集优选方法","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"2c8c46c0c913de9a50abf17ffae2b0df","permalink":"https://realivywong.github.io/pub/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pub/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Publications","type":"widget_page"}]
